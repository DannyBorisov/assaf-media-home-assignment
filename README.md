## Working time:

React login page and auth.php (brevo etc) -  1h
Image upload mechanism - 1.5h
Cleaning up and figuring out the code 0.5h
0.5h - settings up local SQL and PHP (which worked partially but not smooth)
0.5h other stuff (reading docs, chatGPT to figure out php stuff)

I'm not big on PHP or SQL and didnt have enough time to debug things related to DB (compose didnt serve me the data :( )).
Also Brevo failed to send me sms varfication but the API is super simple so that should work.

Anyways, let me know if were meeting on Tuesday or if there's anything else i can do. 

Happy reviewing!!
